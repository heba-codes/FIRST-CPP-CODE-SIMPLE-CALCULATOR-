# FIRST-CPP-CODE-SIMPLE-CALCULATOR-
THIS IS MY FIRST EVER PROGRAMMING PROJECTE WRITTEN IN C AND  UPLOADED PROUDLY TO GITHUB
it's a basic calculator that :
Asks the user to enter two numbers
Take an operation 
Then display the result 
Why I made this?
I'm a computer science student learning how to code step by step 
This project is part of my journey from total beginner to future AI developer
I fixed my own errors 
I understood how to use 'scanf','printf', 'if,else...'
And I learned how to upload a real working project to GitHub

Heba...a computer science student who's just getting started but dreaming big
